# README Generator

## Description

The README Generator is a command-line application built with Node.js that dynamically generates a professional README.md file based on user input using the Inquirer.js package.

## Functionality

Users can run the application with `node index.js` and follow the prompts to enter details such as project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, license, GitHub username, and email address. The application then generates a README.md file with structured sections.
